This app will be updated in real time as updates are made to this github repository! Right now, you can:

1. Upload a left and a right dataset
2. Provide pandas read options in a standard python dictionary
3. Compare the Datasets
4. Download the results!
     - Hover over the top right of the table - there is a download button!
  
Future State:

1. Select Key Columns in Each Dataset
2. More Comprehensive Comparisons Rather than just the simple diff
3. Thresholds for Numeric Column Comparisons
